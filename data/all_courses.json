Analysis of historical data provides a vibrant perspective for understanding Southwest China, not as an area at the margins of Chinese and SEA history, but as a vital link in a chain that connects SEA with the worlds of China and Tibet.

This course will introduce the field of life course research and basic concepts, cover a range of established research topics, with a focus on the theoretical and substantive research in addition to the translation of these research questions into empirical applications. Another central goal will be the introduction of event history techniques and sequence analysis. Students will learn how social survey data, administrative data, and geographic information are synthesized to answer those research questions.",
